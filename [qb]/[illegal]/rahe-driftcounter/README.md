# RAHE Driftcounter
This is a drift counter used by the RAHE Drifing system. It's inspired by similar resources that have been released on the Cfx.re
forums. With permission from the author of EasyDrift (a free drift counter resource), we're using some of the calculation logic from there (which in 
turn, actually, is using logic from FiveM-DriftCounter). 

Our version has been developed further and is developed solely for RAHE Drifting. Mainly, the calculations are more complex and more accurately reward 
the player for taking risks (higher speed, bigger angle). Players get punished for mistakes (drift disabling). The HTML user interface is made from 
scratch to provide the best possible experience and customizability.
