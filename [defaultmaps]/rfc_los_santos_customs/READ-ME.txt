Hey thanks for buying this map, bellow i give you some important informations for your new map.

This map uses customs doors, so i have some files for tuning and sound. 
If you allready have some map with tuning doors probably you need to combine the files to work for all.
This is an simple step.
Choose one file doortuning ymt, open with (Notpad++/Visual Studio Code) and add all customs doors you have on your server.
In gta5 file you can look the line (1133), this line tells the game where is lockated the doortuning file, if you change the location you need to edit the line.
Is very important to not change the name of the resource file, if you do that you need to edit the line 1133.
